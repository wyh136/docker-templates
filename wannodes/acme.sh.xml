      An ACME protocol client written purely in Shell (Unix shell) language.
      Full ACME protocol implementation.
      Support ACME v1 and ACME v2
      Support ACME v2 wildcard certs
      Simple, powerful and very easy to use. You only need 3 minutes to learn it.
      Bash, dash and sh compatible.
      Purely written in Shell with no dependencies on python or the official Let's Encrypt client.
      Just one script to issue, renew and install your certificates automatically.
      DOES NOT require root/sudoer access.
      Docker friendly
      IPv6 support
      Cron job notifications for renewal or error etc.
      It's probably the easiest & smartest shell script to automatically issue & renew the free certificates from Let's Encrypt.
